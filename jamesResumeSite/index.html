				<h3>Welcome to my personal Website!</h3>
				<p>JamesWatkinsResume.com is a personal project of mine. My goal is to not only display my resume online which could already be found on Linkedin.com, but to 
				put my info on the web using technologies like HTML, CSS, and Javascript. Everything on this site was put together by hand for practice and to demonstrate my front end web
				development skills.</p>
				
				<p>The site will continually undergo maintenance as I learn to better use the aformentioned technologies or come up with new ideas in order to demonstrate my skills.</p>
